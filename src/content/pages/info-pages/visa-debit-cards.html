        <p>A VISA debit card provides the most convenient access to your checking account. It can be used anywhere VISA debit cards are accepted. Debit cards work just like a check, meaning you can leave the cash and checkbook at home! It can be used at any of your favorite retailers that accept debit cards, and the money is automatically deducted from your account. The VISA debit card may also be used at participating ATMs to withdraw cash, check your balance, or transfer funds.</p>
